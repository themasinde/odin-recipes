        <h2>What is Braised beef?</h2>
        <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered <br>
            pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised <br>
            in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it <br>
            requires less liquid.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Etc</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons <br>
                pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium <br>
                high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a <br>
                golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to <br>
                cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside. </li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the <br>
                drippings in the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots <br>
                and cook 5 minutes, stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from <br>
                the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. Return the meat <br>
                to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and <br>
                Worcestershire.</li>
            <li>Etc</li>
        </ol>
